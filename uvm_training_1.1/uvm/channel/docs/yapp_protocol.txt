1. OVERVIEW

* This is a simple representative point-to-point protocol.
* It supports one m and one s.
* The protocol data item is packet.

_______________________________________________________
2. SIGNALS

System signals
--------------

* sig_clock - Provides timing for all packets on the DUT, all
  the DUT signals are sampled on the rising edge of 'clock'.  

* sig_reset - This signal asserted state accurs when it is high voltage.
  Anytime this signal is asserted, all signals are initiated.
  It is asserted at the beginning of the test and de-asserted after 500ns.
  `reset` may be asynchronous with the clock.
 
Interface control signals
-------------------------

* sig_valid - This signal is asserted by the m agent
  at the beginning of each packet, and de-asserted at the end
  of the packet.

* sig_ack - This signal is asserted for one cycle during the each s
  response.

Data signal
-----------
 		
* sig_data[31:0] - This signal is used to packet data from the m
  agent to the s agent.

3. Driving a packet

The m agent: 
* Asserts the 'sig_valid' and writes data to the 'sig_data'.	      
* waits for the 'sig_ack' to be asserted.
* De-asserts the 'sig_valid' signal and init 'sig_data'.
* wait one cycle.

The s agent:
* waits for the 'sig_valid' to be asserted.
* read data form the 'sig_data' signal.
* asserts the 'sig_ack' signal for one cycle.
