Example of recording phase transitions as transactions. Currently, there is no
way to query the phasing system for user defined phases, so this prototype only
works for the built-in phases.

To see an example of two domains which are unsynchronized, do:
  irun -uvmhome <path to uvm> phase_watcher_pkg.sv test.sv +UVM_TESTNAME=test -gui

To see a case where the domains are synchronized add +SYNC to the command line
and the domains will be synced so that the first domain done will wait for the
other domain before starting its next phase.

In Simvision, the phase transactions are recorded under "uvm_phases". Each domain
has its own stream that its phases are recorded on.
