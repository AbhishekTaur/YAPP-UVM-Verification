This is the README file for:

SystemVerilog Advanced Veriifcation with UVM version 1.1

For a class at a customer site:
- Before you run any Cadence software, verify your system patch level with
"checkSysConf IUS10.2" and install any missing required patches.
- After installing the course, source the .class_setup script in
this directory.  This shell script sets the path variables to find executables
and libraries.  Modify this script as needed for your platform and shells.

The software products and versions required for this course are:

  -> 29651  Incisive(TM) Enterprise Simulator - XL 10.2

This database has been tested only with v10.20-s100 on these operating
systems:
        Linux RHEL 4.0

The lab database is not tested on any other platform or tool version.

UNIX users can test the database in the uvm/test_install directory

Additionally, these labs need UVM1.0, or better.
A copy of the UVM1-1, modified for compatibility with the Cadence IUS simulator, is included.
